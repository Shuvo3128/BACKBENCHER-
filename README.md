Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Reviews ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews, classifying them as Positive or Negative.
We compare classical machine learning models (TF-IDF + classifiers) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU), and include an interactive demo using the trained LSTM model.

ðŸ›  Approach
1. Data Preprocessing

Removed HTML tags, URLs, emails, and special characters.

Expanded contractions (e.g., donâ€™t â†’ do not).

Lemmatization using spaCy.

Removed stopwords except negations (not, never).

2. Feature Engineering

Classical ML â†’ TF-IDF vectorization with unigrams & bigrams.

Deep Learning â†’ Tokenization, padding sequences, embedding layer.

3. Model Training

Classical â†’ Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Random Forest.

Deep Learning â†’ LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU (with early stopping).

4. Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Visualizations: Confusion matrices, training/validation plots.

ðŸ“¦ Tools & Libraries

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLP: spaCy, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, WordCloud

ML/DL: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

Vectorization: TF-IDF, Keras Tokenizer

ðŸ–¥ LSTM Demo Script

A separate interactive LSTM prediction script allows users to enter a movie review and instantly get the predicted sentiment with confidence score.

How It Works

Loads the trained LSTM model and tokenizer from disk.

Preprocesses the input text (tokenization + padding).

Predicts sentiment probability.

Displays Positive ðŸ˜€ or Negative ðŸ˜  along with the confidence.

Example Run

=== Sentiment Analysis Demo (LSTM) ===

Enter a review (or 'quit' to exit): This film is absolutely awful, but nevertheless
Predicted Sentiment: Negative ðŸ˜   |  Confidence: 0.2580

Enter a review (or 'quit' to exit): I got to see this film at a preview and was da
Predicted Sentiment: Positive ðŸ˜€  |  Confidence: 0.9108

Enter a review (or 'quit' to exit): This adaptation positively butchers a classic
Predicted Sentiment: Positive ðŸ˜€  |  Confidence: 0.7813

Enter a review (or 'quit' to exit): quit
ðŸ‘‹ Goodbye!

Key Takeaways

Classical ML with TF-IDF and Logistic Regression performed slightly better than deep learning in this dataset.

BiLSTM was the best neural model, handling sequential dependencies well.

The demo script provides an engaging way to test the model interactively.
